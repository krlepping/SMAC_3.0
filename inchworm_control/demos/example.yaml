# This is a template for all kinds of valid actions.
# Valid types:
# joint  - Joint actuation. Will go from the robot's current state to new requested state.
#          Order of joints is assumed to be bottom to top.
#          Type of trajectory is cubic (for now)
# magnet - Magnet state. Will publish a MagnetState corresponding to the payload.
#          Both magnets disabled is invalid and will not execute.
# nfc    - NFC read/write. If payload is provided, then it is a write.
# comm   - Communication to nearby robot. If payload contains a `bytes` field, it is a write.

# Duration is in seconds, and is how long the action will last.
example_demo:
  # Demos are executed sequentially
